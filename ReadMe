This is a simple website of myself!

<2022-09-21>
Self-Learning HTML&CSS for the first time, and this website is
a result of my short period of learning. 

Used Netlify to publish HTML code to webpage. 

The HTML code has 3 big sections: Intro(home), Interpretation, and Contact.
Each section has css code for style its text, and imgs

1.Intro is homepage, introducing who I am.
2.Interpretation page has a hyperlink to a sample interpretation video
3.Contact page has hyperlinks to my Github page and email.
